# AutomatedJudge

Welcome to our collaborative effort to design, develop, evaluate, and present an automated judge system for evaluating assignments submitted in Object Oriented Programming 1. The primary objective of our project is to streamline the assessment process for student assignments through the development of a Java-based software application. 

This application will accept a PDF document containing a list of student IDs and a zipped file, following the naming convention "AssignmentX_Java_Programs.zip," where 'X' represents the assignment number. Within this zipped file, student submissions will adhere to the naming format: "StudentID_Name_AX.zip" and each of these subsequent zipped files will contain .java files from the studentâ€™s assignment named after the respective class.
